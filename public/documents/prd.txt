# Schengen Visa Application SaaS - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
VisaEase is a SaaS platform designed to simplify the Schengen visa application process for Turkish citizens. It addresses the pain point of dealing with expensive visa agencies (which charge around 200 euros) by providing an affordable digital alternative. The platform helps users prepare their visa application documents, particularly focusing on automatically filling out the Schengen visa application form and generating supporting documents like letters of intent. This service aims to make the visa application process more accessible, affordable, and less stressful.

## Core Features

### 1. Automated Application Form Filling
- **What**: A system that takes user input and automatically fills out the official Schengen visa application form (PDF/Word document).
- **Why**: This eliminates the tedious and error-prone process of manually filling forms, which is one of the main reasons people use expensive agencies.
- **How**: Users enter their personal details through a user-friendly multi-step form interface, and the system populates the official application form with this information using client-side PDF processing.

### 2. AI-Generated Letter of Intent (Future Feature)
- **What**: An AI tool that helps users draft personalized letters of intent based on their travel purpose and personal circumstances.
- **Why**: Letters of intent are critical for visa approval but difficult to write properly, especially for non-native speakers.
- **How**: The system will use AI to analyze the user's travel plans and generate an appropriate letter that meets visa requirements.

### 3. Document Checklist and Guidance
- **What**: A personalized checklist of required documents based on the user's specific situation and target country.
- **Why**: Ensures users don't miss any required documents, increasing their chances of visa approval.
- **How**: Based on user input about their destination, purpose of travel, and personal circumstances, the system generates a tailored document checklist.

### 4. Document Download and Export
- **What**: Ability to download completed forms and documents in PDF format.
- **Why**: Users need physical copies to submit to VFS Global.
- **How**: The system will render final documents in downloadable formats that can be printed.

## User Experience

### User Personas
1. **First-time Traveler**: Individuals with no previous experience applying for Schengen visas who need comprehensive guidance.
2. **Frequent Traveler**: Users who have applied before but want to save time and money on the process.
3. **Family Applicants**: Users applying for multiple family members who need to manage several applications simultaneously.

### Key User Flows
1. **Registration/Login**: Simple account creation to save progress and manage applications.
2. **Data Collection**: Step-by-step form with route-based navigation to collect all necessary personal information.
3. **Document Generation**: Automatic filling of the application form based on collected data.
4. **Review and Edit**: Ability to review and modify generated documents.
5. **Payment**: One-time payment processing via Lemon Squeezy.

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, modern interface using Shadcn/UI components
- Multi-step wizard with progress indicators showing completion status
- Route-based navigation allowing users to bookmark progress and use browser back/forward buttons
- Form state persistence to prevent data loss
- Mobile-friendly design for users completing forms on various devices
- Initially in Turkish language, with English support planned for future updates
- Clear instructions and tooltips to help users understand requirements

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: PDF form field identification and manipulation complexity.
  **Mitigation**: Create structured field mapping configuration; test early with the actual PDF template; have fallback options like creating our own fillable template if needed.

- **Risk**: Security concerns with sensitive user data.
  **Mitigation**: Process PDFs client-side; avoid storing sensitive application data; implement strong encryption for user accounts.

### Business Challenges
- **Risk**: Changes in visa application requirements.
  **Mitigation**: Design field mapping system for easy updates; monitor official requirements regularly.

- **Risk**: Competition from established agencies.
  **Mitigation**: Focus on competitive pricing (19-49 euros vs 200 euros) and superior user experience; highlight cost savings.

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited development resources for all planned features.
  **Mitigation**: Focus on core PDF filling functionality first; use modular design for easier feature addition.
