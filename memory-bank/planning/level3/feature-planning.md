### Developer Documentation
- [ ] PDF field mapping documentation
- [ ] Form state management documentation
- [ ] Project structure overview

## Creative Phases Required

### UI/UX Design
- [ ] Form wizard UI/UX design
- [ ] Landing page design
- [ ] PDF preview interface design

### Architecture Design
- [ ] Form state management architecture
- [ ] PDF processing workflow
- [ ] Payment integration architecture

### Data Model Design
- [ ] Form data structure design
- [ ] Zod schema design for validation
- [ ] PDF field mapping configuration

## Challenges & Mitigations

### PDF Form Field Identification
- **Challenge**: Correctly mapping form fields to PDF template fields
- **Mitigation**: Create structured field mapping configuration; test early with the actual PDF template; have fallback options like creating our own fillable template if needed

### Form Data Persistence
- **Challenge**: Ensuring form data persists across browser refreshes and sessions
- **Mitigation**: Use Zustand with persistence middleware; implement automatic saving of form progress

### Client-side PDF Processing
- **Challenge**: Performance issues with large PDF processing in browser
- **Mitigation**: Optimize PDF processing; consider chunking operations; add loading indicators

### Payment Integration Security
- **Challenge**: Ensuring secure payment processing
- **Mitigation**: Use Lemon Squeezy's secure checkout; implement proper success/failure handling

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Challenge**: Complex form layout on mobile devices
- **Mitigation**: Mobile-first design approach; extensive testing on various device sizes

## Technology Stack Validation

### Framework & Core Libraries
- [ ] Next.js 15+ with App Router
- [ ] React 19+
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Tailwind CSS 4

### State Management
- [ ] Zustand with persistence plugin

### Form Validation
- [ ] Zod

### UI Components
